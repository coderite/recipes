This is one of my favorite summer salads to bring to barbecues or to pot-luck parties. It also serves well for weekly meal planning! This dish isn't your average green side salad, but has a healthy dose of protein, complex carbs and good-for-you fats. Pair it with lean meat for a complete meal.

Ingredients
1 cup uncooked, dry Quinoa
1 cup shelled, frozen Edamame
1 Red Bell Pepper
1/4 cup chopped Cilantro
1 Lime
1 tbsp Olive Oil
1/2 tsp each of Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Cumin, and Paprika
Salt and Pepper, to taste
Optional Add-ins
1/2 cup cooked Black Beans
1/2 Red Onion, chopped
1 Tomato, chopped
1/2 Cucumber, chopped
1/4 cup Hummus

Directions
Bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup dry quinoa to a rolling boil. Boil for 2 minutes.
Reduce to a simmer and cover. Allow to cook for another 15 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
In a separate small saucepan, boil frozen edamame in water for 5 minutes, or until fully cooked.
Once quinoa and edamame are fully cooked, add all ingredients in a large bowl and mix until all flavors are incorporated.
